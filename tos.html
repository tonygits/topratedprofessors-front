                                    <h3>Provision for Refund</h3>
                                    <p>The customer should read through the product before releasing 100% of the funds to the writer.
                                            By releasing 100% of the funds, the customer agrees that he/she had read through the entire
                                            product and is satisfied with it. As such, he/she agrees that he will not require any further
                                            revision on the same order. In case one might need a revision on such order, he/ she will have to
                                            place a new order and make payment for the same. Funds released after delivery of our products
                                            are not warranted or guaranteed in any way and are completely non-refundable. The customer
                                            should take the time to read through the product and decide whether he/ she needs any form of
                                            revision before releasing the funds to the writer as no refund can be made after that. After 100%
                                            release of funds, there can be no further communication made to the writer concerning the order.
                                            In case the customer does not release 100% of the funds after downloading the final paper, the
                                            funds will be automatically released to the writer 72 hours after the deadline and the order will
                                            be considered as complete, and therefore the writer will not take any further revisions on the
                                            same order.</p>
                                            <p>At our own discretion, we might decide to refund the customer especially when they have
                                                    enough reason to claim a refund. We have a money back guarantee policy that you can read on
